CSC209 Course Syllabus -- Summer 2015

Overview

   Welcome to CSC209: Software Tools and Systems Programming. The course
   is designed to introduce software techniques and tools used in a
   Unix/Linux environment. We will study C, a low-level programming
   language, and use it to examine the interface between the operating
   system and user-level programs.

     * Suggested Textbooks:
          + King, [14]C Programming: A Modern Approach. W. W. Norton and
            Company, 2008 (highly recommended)
          + Kerrisk, [15]Linux Programming Interface. No Starch Press,
            2010 ([16]errata)
     * Website and Discussion Board: The course website contains lecture
       notes, assignment handouts, and, most importantly, a link to the
       [17]Piazza discussion board. The board can get you fast, accurate
       response to your questions a but it only works if everyone
       participates! We will also use the boards to post announcements and
       updates, so Piazza is required daily reading.
     * Email: Please use email for personal issues and the discussion
       board for all other course-related questions. I try to respond to
       email by the end of the next day. However, due to volume, it may
       take longer, especially on weekends (I am often not able to answer
       email more than once on the weekend.)
     * Anonymous Feedback: If you have feedback about the course, the
       course web page includes a [18]link to an anonymous email form.
       (You also have the option of including your name.) Since the sender
       cannot be determined, comments sent through the feedback system are
       considered public, and they may receive a response at the beginning
       of class or on Piazza.

Grading Scheme and Assignment Schedule

   Type of Work Topics Weight Due Date
   Exercises 4% 10pm on Friday
   A1 Basic C 8% Wednesday, June 10 at 10pm
   A2 C and Pointers 10% Wednesday, July 1 at 10pm
   Midterm Shell and C 15% [19]Tuesday, June 23 from 7-8pm in UC 266
   A3 Processes and Pipes 10% Wednesday, July 22 at 10pm
   A4 Network Server 8% Friday, August 7 at 11:59pm
   Final Exam Everything 45%

   To pass the course you must receive at least 40% on the final exam. The
   highest mark you will receive if your grade on the final exam is less
   than 40% is 47%.

   Any section of an assignment in which the C program does not compile on
   CDF will receive a grade of 0. If you can explain clearly in a
   remarking request how to fix the problem, your program will be remarked
   with a 20% penalty. Errors in submission such as missing files,
   incorrectly named files, putting files in the wrong place may be graded
   with a 20% penalty.

Policies

     * Late Work: All assignments are submitted electronically and are due
       at 10 p.m. sharp on the due date (with the sole exception being for
       Assignment 4, which is due at 11:59 p.m. on the due date.) Each
       student begins the semester with three grace day tokens.
          + At most two grace days may be used for a single assignment.
          + Submitting an assignment up to 1 day (24 hours) late uses one
            token. Submitting an assignment up to 2 days (48 hours) late
            uses two tokens. Once your tokens have been used late
            assignments will not be accepted.
          + Grace days may not be used for labs.
          + Grace days may not be used for Assignment 4.
          + Please note that 10:01 p.m. will be considered late (or
            12:00am for A4), therefore ensure that your work is not
            submitted at the very last second. Because you will be using
            version control, it is very easy to commit regularly to avoid
            running into the deadline.

   Remarking requests that result from incorrect submissions will receive
   a 20% penalty.
     * Religious Holidays: If a religious holiday will keep you from
       completing any assigned work, please let me know as soon as
       possible (but no later than two weeks before the due date), and we
       will work out a mutually agreeable accommodation.
     * Emergencies: In the event of an illness or other catastrophe,
       obtain appropriate documentation (e.g., medical certificate) and
       contact me by email within 48 hours of the due date. It is always
       easier to make alternate arrangements before a due date, so please
       inform me as soon as you know that you will need accommodation.
     * Re-mark Requests: If a piece of work has been mis-marked or if you
       believe the rubric used to evaluate the work is not appropriate,
       you may request a re-mark. For a re-mark to succeed, you must
       clearly and concisely express what you believe was mis-marked. To
       request a re-mark, use the form for the assignment on [20]MarkUs.
       Requests must be submitted within 2 weeks of the marks being
       returned.
     * Academic Integrity: All of the work you submit must be done by you
       and your work must not be submitted by someone else. Plagiarism is
       academic fraud and is taken very seriously. The department uses
       software that compares programs for evidence of similar code.
       Please read the [21]Rules and Regulations from the U of T Calendar
       (especially the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters). Here are a
       couple of guidelines to help you avoid plagiarism:
          + Never look at another student's or group's assignment solution
            or idea for a solution, whether it is on paper or on the
            computer screen, and don't allow your solution to be viewed by
            or come into the possession of another student.
          + Maintain absolute control of your work a including notes and
            partial solutions a at all times.
          + We encourage you to discuss course concepts and to study for
            exams with other students, but any work that is submitted
            should be your own. The easiest way to avoid plagiarism is to
            only discuss submitted work with your partner or the
            instructor.
          + Similarly, Google (and Wikipedia) may help you with course
            material, but do not use the internet to look for solutions to
            the assignment problems.
     * Accessibility Needs: The University of Toronto is committed to
       accessibility. If you require accommodations for a disability, or
       have any accessibility concerns about the course, the classroom or
       course materials, please contact Accessibility Services as soon as
       possible: [22]accessibility.services@utoronto.ca or
       [23]http://www.accessibility.utoronto.ca/.
