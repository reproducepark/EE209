Google Inc. is an American multinational technology company specializing 
in Internet-related services and products. These include online 
advertising technologies, search, cloud computing, and software.[5] 
Most of its profits are derived from AdWords,[6][7] an online advertising 
service that places advertising near the list of search results.
Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. 
students at Stanford University. Together, they own about 14 percent of 
its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through
 supervoting stock. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on 
September 4, 1998. 
An initial public offering followed on August 19, 2004. 
Its mission statement from the outset was "to organize the world's 
information and make it universally accessible and useful,"[8] 
and its unofficial slogan was "Don't
 be evil".[9][10] In 2004, Google moved to its new headquarters in Mountain 
View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex.[11] In August 2015, Google 
announced plans to reorganize its interests as a holding company called 
Alphabet Inc. When this restructuring took place on October 2, 2015, Google 
became Alphabet's leading subsidiary, as well as the parent for Google's 
Internet interests.[12][13][14][15][16]
